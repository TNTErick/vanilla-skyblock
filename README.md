## Description
The idea of a Sky Island has stucked around in Steve's and Alex' blockheads. From the modded Sky Factory series, the heavily datapacked Hypixel Skyblock, to the OneBlock map, there were no pure vanilla skyblock implementations for the fact that some of the critical resources like dirt, lava and even iron were hard to acquire if not impossible in vanilla Minecraft. Things have changed, however, 1.14's village, 1.16's bartering and 1.17's dripstone all made life easier. 

Simply setting the world to the void superflat type and creative-craftting your own island is easier. This raise up two problems though:
- The biome is 'minecraft:the_void' which means no creature spawn. Even setting other biome causes mild trouble in long-term because some biome-specified farm could not be built.
- The nether and the end is not affected. Some find it relieved. Some find it boring.
The solution to this is simply to alter the [World Settings](https://misode.github.io/world/).
